    // JS Features
    
    /* 
    1.) High Level - Every program that runs on your computer needs some hardware resources,such as memory and 
                the CPU to do its work. low-level languages, such as C,where you have to manually manage these resources.
                ou have high-level languages such as JavaScript and Python, where we do not have to manage resources at all 
                because these languages have so-called abstractions that take all of that work away from us. the language 
                easier to learn and to use, but the downside is that programs will never be as fast or as optimized as 
                for example, C programs.


    2.) Garbage collection -  One of the powerful tools that takes memory management away from developers is garbage-collection,
                        which is basically an algorithm inside the JavaScript engine, which automatically removes old, unused 
                        objects.from the computer memory in order not to clog it up with unnecessary stuff.which cleans  
                        memory from time to time so that we don't have to do it manually in our code.

    3.) Interpreted or JIT - JavaScript is an interpreted or just-in-time compiled language.the computer's  processor only understands 
                          zeros and ones. which is also called machine code. this code eventually needs to be translated to machine 
                          code. And that step can be either compiling or interpreting. this happens inside the JavaScript engine.

    4.) Multiparadigm - A paradigm is an approach and an overall mindset of structuring our code, which will ultimately direct 
                    the coding style and technique in a project that uses a certain paradigm.  three popular paradigms are procedural, 
                    object-oriented, and functional programming.So procedural programming is what we've been doing so far,which is basically just organizing the code in a very linear way, and then with some functions in between. we can classify paradigms as imperative or as declarative, many languages are only procedural or only object-oriented or only functional,but JavaScript does all of it. So it's really flexible and versatile. And so we can do really whatever we want with it.

    5.) Prototype-based OOP - Everything in JavaScript is an object, except for primitive values such as numbers, strings, etc. 
                          But arrays are just object. Now,  we can create an array and then use the push method on it, for example? 
                          Well, it's because of prototypal inheritance. Basically, we create arrays from an array blueprint, which is 
                          like a template and this is called the prototype. This prototype contains all the array methods and the 
                          arrays that we create in our code then inherit the methods from the blueprint so that we can use them on the arrays. 

    6.) Dynamic - which means that variables can hold values of different types during runtime.

    7.) single threaded and non-blocking - That means how the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.

    8.) First class function - First-class functions, which simply means that functions are treated just as regular variables. 
                           so, we can pass   functions into other functions and we can even return functions from functions. and this allows for functional-programming, which is one of the paradigms and actually not all languages have first-class functions..
